tivu is short for Test Instrument Viewer. The intention is to
emulate a printer for testinstruments printing out in the HP PCL language.

It is from the very beginning only made to support me (spe) and my
test instrument  (HP E8285A), but I am sure it should be able to
support more instrument. It will probably grow as I find more instruments
I want to do printouts from.

The code is written in Python using wx as graphical interface and pyserial
for serial communication. The code is released under the "New BSD" license.

The user interface for the program is built using wxglade. To generate
the tivuGUI.py file from tivu.wxg, use make. The make program calls
wxglade to generate the tivuGUI.py file.

Directories:
- python: the python sourcecode of the actual implementation.
 -c-src: a C implementation that takes a dumped file as an argument and displays the image using SDL.
- dump-prog: a program that dumps the data from the instrument to a file
to be used as a reference when developing.
- samples directory contains samples of PCL files from different instruments.
- doc contains some PCL documentation files.
