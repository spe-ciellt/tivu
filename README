tivu is short for Test Instrument Viewer. The intention is to
be a printer for testinstrument printing out in the HP PCL language.

It is from the very begining only made to support me (spe) and my
test instrument  (HP E8285A), but I am sure it should be able to
support more instrument.

The code is written in Python using wx as graphical interface and pyserial
for serial communication. The code is released under the "New BSD" license.

The user interface for the program is built using wxglade. To generate
the tivuGUI.py file from from tivu.wxg, use make. the make program calls
wxglade to generate the tivuGUI.py file.

- python directory contains the python sourcecode of the actual implementation.
 -src directory contains an SDL implementation that takes a dumped file as
an argument.
- dump-prog contains program that dumps the data from the instrument to a file
to be used as a reference when developing.
- samples directory contains samples from my HP E8285A
- doc contains some PCL documentation files
